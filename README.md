# unsupervised-learning-final-assignment
This is an associated code repository for my assignment for the course Unsupervised Learning. It contains the script 'create_figures.py' as well as the data needed to run it. The data consists of the computed clustering and metrics for the 5,760 clusterings that were computed for this work, as described on the submitted document.
